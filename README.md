**Portfolio website with flask on pythonanywhere**

This repo contains code for my portfolio website built using flask and deployed on pythonanywhere website. This is my first project.

The final product can be viewed here: [ngzhiyi's portfolio website](https://ngzhiyi.pythonanywhere.com/)

The website contains my portfolio, as well as a simple comment section (only logged in users can comment and/or delete their comments).
